01:40:09	Omar Vargas:	What are the deadlines or dates to remember if interested in your upcoming November 2020 CodeStack school/class? My big holdback to applying is not being able to meet and learn in person v.s. online only learning.
01:42:45	Arisabeth:	I've come across one where they asked for code snippets that you've done and wants you to walk them through the codes with you
01:45:33	Mark Hypolite:	https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850
01:49:53	Arisabeth:	Hey Omar, check out the site for that https://codestackacademy.org/
01:51:38	Omar Vargas:	Thanks
01:53:56	Omar Vargas:	HTML + CSS - responsive programming/design!!
01:55:12	Omar Vargas:	Yes!! Symantec HTML!!!
01:57:16	Arisabeth:	Given my experience HTML + CSS is very useful to know even if you're more into design. I've been thrown into coding out components and styling last min to help speed up the process and then the dev will take that and hook up the logic so even if someone is more interested in design I'd say having that skill set under your belt is very useful
01:58:08	CodeStack Moderator:	Thanks Arisabeth, good feedback
02:02:23	Steve J:	Thank you Mark and Zack! This was very helpful for me.
02:02:39	josephracca:	Thanks!
02:02:48	Arisabeth:	thanks Mark and Zack
