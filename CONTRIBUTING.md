## Zip archives
When you add a folder, a GitHub action will run the `zip.sh` script to archive the folder's contents, storing them in that folder as a zip file. It will not update any zip file already stored in the repository. If you change the contents of a folder, you are responsible for updating that folder's zip file.

If you use `zip.sh` to update the zip, bear in mind that it can often recreate zip files in git unnecessarily. You do not need to commit all the files that `zip.sh` creates â€” only the zip corresponding to a folder you personally changed.
