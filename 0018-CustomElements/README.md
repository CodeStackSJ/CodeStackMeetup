# Introduction

## What are Custom Elements?

A way for web developers to design & use HTML Elements that don't exist.

## Why use it?

Custom Elements allow you to simplify your code by integrating it directly with the browser. Custom Elements can do anything an HTML Element can do, as well as any behavior that you define. Custom Elements can be used without including a library or requiring a build step.

## What else is like it?

Custom Elements were designed based on the Component design pattern, initially popularized by React & adopted by Angular, Vue and others.
