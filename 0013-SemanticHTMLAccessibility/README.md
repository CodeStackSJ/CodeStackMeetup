# Introduction

## What is Semantic HTML?

The use of tags & attributes to encode information into your site.

## Why use it?

In a way, you're always using it â€” all HTML is "semantic" to some degree, in that it always provides information about your site's structure & data. As a result, you must be careful how you write your markup, or you can "break" these semantics by using them incorrectly.

This information is used by various programs to present your site in different ways. The most well-known example is via assistive technologies, which can use it to e.g. read a site's main content or navigation menu to a visually impaired person. Even something as "small" as a JavaScript element query, however, is an example of this dynamic.
