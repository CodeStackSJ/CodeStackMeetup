# Setting Up

## Install git

Usually can just download an installer from [the git homepage](https://www.git-scm.com), but other options exist:

- Many desktop clients (e.g. GitHub) bundle git with them
- Apple distributes git with its Command Line Tools package (run `xcode-select --install` — you don't need xcode installed)

## Customize git behavior

Put a `.gitconfig` in your home folder

- `C:/Users/<account>/` on Windows
- `/Users/<account>/` on macOS
- Tons and tons and TONS of options
- Starting point: [Customizing Git - Git Configuration](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration)

## Authenticate with the git server (e.g. Azure DevOps)

Two options:

- Rely on the operating system to handle HTTPS security tokens for you, which may mean logging in at multiple seemingly random times and/or modifying system credential managers when things break
- Use older, widely supported SSH authentication, which means setting up files in an `.ssh` folder in your home folder (see [this GitHub guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) for more; the advice is usable for any git service — including Azure DevOps — that supports SSH)

## Create/fetch a git repo

- Create a repo from `git init` from the folder you want to add git to
- Fetch a repo with `git clone` from the folder one level above where the repo would be (see [Working with Repositories](working-with-repositories.md))
- All done!

## Hide files/folders from git

Create a `.gitignore` file in the folder you ran `git init` from

- One entry per line
- Usually for stuff generated by a tool (e.g. `node_modules`, `bin`, `obj`)
- Uses glob syntax (see [this wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_%28programming%29#Syntax))
