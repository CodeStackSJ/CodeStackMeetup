# Introduction

## What is git?

A special filesystem for keeping track of changes

## Why use it?

Unlike a centralized version store — e.g., CVS, Subversion or Team Foundation Server — you can copy git's records to another computer without affecting anyone else

## What else is like it?

Mercurial is the most common, but you can find others by looking up "distributed version control"
