# Merge Conflicts

## Why
Merge conflicts happen when two or more commits changing the same file are introduced in a single branch. In most cases, git can automatically fix it; otherwise, it forces you to fix it manually.

## Fixing
- Edit the text directly
- Can use a specialized tool, like a diff editor (usually built into a code editor)

## Demonstration
- `*Performs a merge conflict*`
