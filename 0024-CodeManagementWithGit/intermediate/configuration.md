# Configuration

## Install git

- Download an installer from [the git homepage](https://www.git-scm.com)
- Install a client application that bundles git or automatically installs it for you (e.g. GitHub Desktop)
- On macOS, run `xcode-select --install` to install the Command Line Tools package, which includes git
- Build git yourself

## Customize git behavior

Put a `.gitconfig` in your home folder

- `C:/Users/<account>/` on Windows
- `/Users/<account>/` on macOS
- Tons and tons and TONS of options
- Starting point: [Customizing Git - Git Configuration](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration)
- See the [`.gitconfig`](.gitconfig) in this folder

## Authenticate with the git server (e.g. GitHub)

- If you have a desktop client, that will handle global authentication through its interface
- Rely on the credential manager for your operating system
- Use SSH key authentication, which means setting up files in an `.ssh` folder in your home folder (see [this GitHub guide] for more; the advice is usable for any git service that supports SSH)

## Create/fetch a git repo

- Create a repo from `git init` from the folder you want to add git to
- Fetch a repo with `git clone` from the folder one level above where the repo would be (see [Working with Repositories](working-with-repositories.md))
- All done!

## Hide files/folders from git

Create a `.gitignore` file in the folder you ran `git init` from

- One entry per line
- Usually for stuff generated by a tool (e.g. `node_modules`, `bin`, `obj`)
- Uses [glob syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_%28programming%29#Syntax)
