# Project Euler Programming: A Puzzler Approach

## VS Code Extensions

`C# (ms-dotnettools.csharp)` by Microsoft

## DotNet
Dotnet is required, if not installed, please find it here https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

Can verify your install by using terminal or console
`dotnet --version`
Host will be using version 3.1.102

## Create project
`dotnet new console`

Upon creation, you should get a notification from vscode to add missing files that are required for c#. Say yes and it will add the following directory and files. Per my norm but `this is not required to run the program`
```
.vscode/launch.json
.vscode/tasks.json
```

### Lets get started!

With a final note: to run the programs we will run the following command:

`dotnet run`
